## Why you should use this library
* React compatible
* Simple to use
* Light weight:
    * 855 byte of CSS
    * 3 KB of JS
* TypeScript compatible
* Free of design: There are no buttons, or any other CSS classes than the necessary for the animation and responsiveness.
* Responsive design

## Constrains
* All images should have the same aspect ratio.
* Only works with React 17+

## Browsers compatibility
This is the list of tested browsers in `mac OS 11.1 BigSur`
* Safari `14.0.2`
* Firefox `86.0`
* Chromium `89.0.4389.72`

## How it works?
`react-photo-carousel` uses CSS `transform` property to create smooth animations without repainting any other part of the DOM.

There are other options, of carousel libraries and alternatives to this one like:
* [Glider](https://nickpiscitelli.github.io/Glider.js/), is also a high performance Carousel library, with a lot of options of carousel to choose from. This one is not specially developed for any frontend library.
* [Slick](https://nickpiscitelli.github.io/Glider.js/): I personally think Glider is a best option, but this one is also a really complete library, but sadly it repaints other elements in the DOM, so it doesnâ€™t have the best performance you can get.

But if you are looking for a simple, react compatible, no design, light weight and high performance solution this one is really good for you.
